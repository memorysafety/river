/// A concurrent rate limiting structure
///
/// ## Implementation details and notes
///
/// For performance and resource reasons, this provides an *approximation* of exact rate
/// limiting. Currently, there are a few "false positive" cases that can permit more than
/// the expected number of actions to occur.
///
/// Rater is currently modeled as a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache of leaky buckets mapped
/// by a key. This is done to provide a bounded quantity of leaky buckets, without requiring
/// a worker task to "cull" the oldest buckets. Instead, unused buckets will naturally
/// "fall out" of the cache if they are not used.
///
/// ### Too many unique keys at too high of a rate
///
/// If there is a very high diversity of Keys provided, it is possible that keys could
/// be evicted from the cache before they would naturally expire or be refilled. In this
/// case, Rater will appear to not apply rate limiting, as the evicted bucket will be
/// replaced with a new, initially full bucket. This can be mitigated by choosing a
/// bucket storage capacity that is large enough to hold enough buckets to handle the
/// expected requests per second. e.g. if there is room for 1M buckets, and a bucket would
/// refill one token every 100ms, then we would expect to be able to handle at least 100K
/// requests with unique keys per second without evicting the buckets before the bucket
/// would refill anyway.
///
/// ### A burst of previously-unseen keys
///
/// If a number of requests appear around the same time for a Key that is not resident
/// in the cache, it is possible that all worker threads will create a new bucket and
/// attempt to add their buckets to the cache, though only one will be persisted, and
/// the others will be lost.
///
/// For example if there are N worker threads, and N requests with the same key arrive
/// at roughly the same time, it is possible that we will create N new leaky buckets,
/// each that will give one immediately-ready token for the request. However, in the
/// worst case (N - 1) of these tokens won't "count", as (N - 1) of these buckets
/// will be thrown away, and not counted in the one bucket that was persisted
///
/// This worst case is extremely unlikely, as it would require N requests with the same Key
/// to arrive in the time window necessary to write to the cache, and for all N requests
/// to be distributed to N different worker threads that all attempt to find the Key
/// at the same time.
///
/// There is no mitigation for this currently, other than treating the "max tokens per
/// bucket" as an approximate value, with up to "number of worker threads" of false
/// positives as an acceptable bound.
